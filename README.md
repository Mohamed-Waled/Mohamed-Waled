## Small Story About Me üë®‚Äçüíª :

I'm an engineering student at the Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, who has
a passion for the field of web development especially Front-End Development for now.

I've started learning web development for the first time from an Egyptian free scholarship 
called Egypt Future Work Is Digital [egFWD] powerd by the Ministry of Communication and 
Information Technology and I've finished the first two levels at it :

- The Web Development Challenger Track > [The Certificate 1]
- Front End Web Development Professional with two projects > [The Certificate 2]
    - Landing Page > [Live Site URL 1]
    - Weather Journal App

Then I took Responsive Web Design Course at FreeCodeCamp [FCC] :

- Responsive Web Design with five Projects > [The Certificate 3]
    - Tribute Page > [Live Site URL 2]
    - Survey Form > [Live Site URL 3]
    - Product Landing Page > [Live Site URL 4]
    - Technical Documentation Page > [Live Site URL 5]
    - Personal Portfolio Webpage > [Live Site URL 6]

And now I solve challenges at both [Frontend Mentor] and [CSS Battle] such as :

- Frontend Mentore :
    - QR Code Component > [Live Site URL 7]
    - NFT Preview Card Component > [Live Site URL 8]
    - Order Summary Component > [Live Site URL 9]
    - Stats Preview Card Component > [Live Site URL 10]
    - 3-Column Preview Card Component > [Live Site URL 11]
    - Profile Card Component > [Live Site URl 12]

And now I'm learning JavaScript from FreeCodeCamp and [Elzero web school] from youtube

### And That's It, Nice to Meet You All ‚ù§Ô∏è üëã .
