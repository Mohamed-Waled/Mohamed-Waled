## Small Story About Me üë®‚Äçüíª:

> Every day is a learning day.

I'm a self-learner -or should I say online learner- who started studying Front-End Development in December 2020. My journey started with an online course on Udacity, which was powered by [egFWD] for web development. This course specialized in Front-End web development and sparked my passion for the subject. Since then, I have been continuously learning about Front-End Development.

Since I began my journey, I have gained a lot of knowledge. I have progressed to learning React.js and Next.js, and I am currently putting my skills into practice. By doing so, I can identify the areas I need to improve on to proudly call myself a Front-End Developer.

I've started with an Egyptian free scholarship called Egypt Future Work Is Digital [egFWD] powerd by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and I've finished the first two levels at it:

- [The Web Development Challenger Track]
- [Front End Web Development Professional with two projects]
  - [Landing Page]
  - Weather Journal App using Node.js

Then I took Responsive Web Design Course at FreeCodeCamp [FCC]:

- [Responsive Web Design with five Projects]
  - [Tribute Page]
  - [Survey Form]
  - [Product Landing Page]
  - [Technical Documentation Page]
  - [Personal Portfolio Webpage]
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures with five Projects]
  - [Palindrome Checker]
  - [Roman Numeral Converter]
  - [Caesars Cipher]
  - [Telephone Number Validator]
  - [Cash Register]

P.S. You can find all of them with the solutions in the certificate link.

- [Front End Development Libraries with five Projects]
  - [Random Quote Machine]
  - [Markdown Previewer]
  - [Drum Machine]
  - [JavaScript Calculator]
  - [A 25 + 5 Clock]

And now I solve challenges at both [Frontend Mentor] and [CSS Battle] such as:

- Frontend Mentore :
  - [QR Code Component]
  - [NFT Preview Card Component]
  - [Order Summary Component]
  - [Stats Preview Card Component]
  - [3-Column Preview Card Component]
  - [Profile Card Component]
  - [Social Proof Section]
  - [Four Card Feature Section]
  - [Single Price Grid Component]
  - [Huddle Landing Page With a Single Introductory Section]
  - [Testimonials Grid Section]
  - [Fylo Data Storage Component]
  - [Clipboard Landing Page]
  - [Huddle Landing Page With Alternating Feature Blocks]
  - [Fylo Landing Page With Two Column Layout]
  - [Product Preview Card Component]

Now I'm Just Making Some Websites and App For The Purpose of Training and Upgrade My Skills:

- Don't Hesitate About Trying Them
  - [webSite]
  - [Distance Calculator Between Two Points V 2.0]
  - [To-Do App]

What comes after this? My ultimate objective is to become a competent and knowledgeable Software Engineer who comprehends their duties and performs them proficiently.

### And That's It, Nice to Meet You All ‚ù§Ô∏è üëã .
