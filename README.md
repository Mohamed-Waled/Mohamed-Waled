## Small Story About Me üë®‚Äçüíª:

I'm an engineering student at the Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, who has
a passion for the field of web development especially Front-End Development for now.

I've started learning web development for the first time from an Egyptian free scholarship 
called Egypt Future Work Is Digital [egFWD] powerd by the Ministry of Communication and 
Information Technology and I've finished the first two levels at it:

- The Web Development Challenger Track > [The Certificate 1]
- Front End Web Development Professional with two projects > [The Certificate 2]
    - Landing Page > [Live Site URL 1]
    - Weather Journal App

Then I took Responsive Web Design Course at FreeCodeCamp [FCC]:

- Responsive Web Design with five Projects > [The Certificate 3]
    - Tribute Page > [Live Site URL 2]
